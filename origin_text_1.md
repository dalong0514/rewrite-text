OK, so we've now given an outline of how ChatGPT works once it's set up. But how did it get set up? How were all those 175 billion weights in its neural net determined? Basically they're the result of very large-scale training, based on a huge corpus of text—on the web, in books, etc.—written by humans. As we've said, even given all that training data, it's certainly not obvious that a neural net would be able to successfully produce "human-like" text. And, once again, there seem to be detailed pieces of engineering needed to make that happen. But the big surprise—and discovery—of ChatGPT is that it's possible at all. And that—in effect—a neural net with "just" 175 billion weights can make a "reasonable model" of text humans write.

In modern times, there's lots of text written by humans that's out there in digital form. The public web has at least several billion human-written pages, with altogether perhaps a trillion words of text. And if one includes non-public webpages, the numbers might be at least 100 times larger. So far, more than 5 million digitized books have been made available (out of 100 million or so that have ever been published), giving another 100 billion or so words of text. And that's not even mentioning text derived from speech in videos, etc. (As a personal comparison, my total lifetime output of published material has been a bit under 3 million words, and over the past 30 years I've written about 15 million words of email, and altogether typed perhaps 50 million words—and in just the past couple of years I've spoken more than 10 million words on livestreams. And, yes, I'll train a bot from all of that.)

But, OK, given all this data, how does one train a neural net from it? The basic process is very much as we discussed it in the simple examples above. You present a batch of examples, and then you adjust the weights in the network to minimize the error ("loss") that the network makes on those examples. The main thing that's expensive about "back propagating" from the error is that each time you do this, every weight in the network will typically change at least a tiny bit, and there are just a lot of weights to deal with. (The actual "back computation" is typically only a small constant factor harder than the forward one.)

With modern GPU hardware, it's straightforward to compute the results from batches of thousands of examples in parallel. But when it comes to actually updating the weights in the neural net, current methods require one to do this basically batch by batch. (And, yes, this is probably where actual brains—with their combined computation and memory elements—have, for now, at least an architectural advantage.)

Even in the seemingly simple cases of learning numerical functions that we discussed earlier, we found we often had to use millions of examples to successfully train a network, at least from scratch. So how many examples does this mean we'll need in order to train a "human-like language" model? There doesn't seem to be any fundamental "theoretical" way to know. But in practice ChatGPT was successfully trained on a few hundred billion words of text.

Some of the text it was fed several times, some of it only once. But somehow it "got what it needed" from the text it saw. But given this volume of text to learn from, how large a network should it require to "learn it well"? Again, we don't yet have a fundamental theoretical way to say. Ultimately—as we'll discuss further below—there's presumably a certain "total algorithmic content" to human language and what humans typically say with it. But the next question is how efficient a neural net will be at implementing a model based on that algorithmic content. And again we don't know—although the success of ChatGPT suggests it's reasonably efficient.

And in the end we can just note that ChatGPT does what it does using a couple hundred billion weights—comparable in number to the total number of words (or tokens) of training data it's been given. In some ways it's perhaps surprising (though empirically observed also in smaller analogs of ChatGPT) that the "size of the network" that seems to work well is so comparable to the "size of the training data". After all, it's certainly not that somehow "inside ChatGPT" all that text from the web and books and so on is "directly stored". Because what's actually inside ChatGPT are a bunch of numbers—with a bit less than 10 digits of precision—that are some kind of distributed encoding of the aggregate structure of all that text.

Put another way, we might ask what the "effective information content" is of human language and what's typically said with it. There's the raw corpus of examples of language. And then there's the representation in the neural net of ChatGPT. That representation is very likely far from the "algorithmically minimal" representation (as we'll discuss below). But it's a representation that's readily usable by the neural net. And in this representation it seems there's in the end rather little "compression" of the training data; it seems on average to basically take only a bit less than one neural net weight to carry the "information content" of a word of training data.

When we run ChatGPT to generate text, we're basically having to use each weight once. So if there are n weights, we've got of order n computational steps to do—though in practice many of them can typically be done in parallel in GPUs. But if we need about n words of training data to set up those weights, then from what we've said above we can conclude that we'll need about n2 computational steps to do the training of the network—which is why, with current methods, one ends up needing to talk about billion-dollar training efforts.
